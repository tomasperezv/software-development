Thoughts on software development

### Agile Manifesto

We are uncovering better ways of developing
software by doing it and helping others do it.
Through this work we have come to value:

Individuals and interactions over processes and tools  
Working software over comprehensive documentation  
Customer collaboration over contract negotiation  
Responding to change over following a plan  

That is, while there is value in the items on
the right, we value the items on the left more.

### Agile principles

Customer satisfaction by early and continuous delivery of valuable software  
Welcome changing requirements, even in late development  
Working software is delivered frequently (weeks rather than months)  
Close, daily cooperation between business people and developers  
Projects are built around motivated individuals, who should be trusted  
Face-to-face conversation is the best form of communication (co-location)  
Working software is the principal measure of progress  
Sustainable development, able to maintain a constant pace  
Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design  
Simplicity—the art of maximizing the amount of work not done—is essential  
Self-organizing teams  
Regular adaptation to changing circumstance
